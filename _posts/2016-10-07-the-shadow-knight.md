We finally reached a major milestone in our 
*[Relics of Acyrus]({{site.url}}/tag/the relics of acyrus/)* campaign
and it all came down to a final battle with the villain who had been
orchestrating all of the evil plots with the goblins and in Beowood. The
[previous session]({{site.url}}/2016/08/17/temple-of-divinity.html) 
was spent getting to the Temple of Divinity and since
time was running short, we left the final scene for our next meeting.<!--more-->

The heroes left off in the Temple of Divinity. They overcame all of the temple's
various traps and puzzles and reached the final room where the Relic of Divinity
was said to be. However, the relic was missing and the room was flooded with a
thick black smoke.

A dark figure in jagged armor lurked forward from the back of the room with
several goblin minions in tow. In his hand was a spiked flail; the head of it
like a catholic censor, pouring out smoke. He toyed with the heroes showing them
the prize they were after, the relic of divinity, already in his possession, and
to his surprise it started glowing. Desmond looked down and it seemed the relic
of Transmutation, in his pocket, was glowing as well. Seeing the this, the dark
knight cloaked in shadow tossed his artifact to Frosz so that the knight could
retrieve the other. Frosz worked on creating a teleportation circle as an escape
route, and a battle ensued.

## The Fight

I tried to make the fight fun to play with a couple of different elements.
First, I put Frosz the Goblin Shaman on top of a large sphinx statue in the back
of the room with two goblin archers. Frosz worked on a teleportation ritual
(which I set up as a contest with set difficulties basically) to
create an escape route for the Shadow Knight and company. He also had the one of
the two relics in the room, but he was about 3 zones from where the PCs started
and in cover behind the statue's head. The PCs had to be in a zone right next to
statue to even attempt a shot at him. The goblin archers mostly laid down cover
fire to keep the heroes at the far end of the room.

While that was going on I also had 4 goblins on the ground (2 mobs of 2). These
guys were also pretty easy kills, but they hung back and took on PCs
individually as they tried to progress towards Frosz. They tried mostly to
create advantages and mostly failed at everything (although, they did hit
Desmond pretty good a couple of times).

Lastly, the Shadow Knight himself was statted as a tank. His highest skill was
Fantastic (+6) and he had some cool stunts to disappear into the smoke. He went
to the front line and mainly tried keeping people away from Frosz but also tried
to wear down Desmond so that he could steal his relic.

I thought the setup for the fight was pretty cool, and that it would be a really
good challenge for the PCs. I did not have a planned outcome. I just wanted to
challenge them and see what happened. However, when we got down to the actual
combat, things didn't play out as well.

I had given the players a couple compels the previous session, and they still
had some left over from the session before that. Even worse, I was a little to
careless with how many free invokes I gave them. When they walked into the final
room, before the shadow knight revealed himself, the PCs each set up one or two
advantages. So going into the fight, the players were swimming in +2 bonuses.
Clearly this is my fault for allowing all of this, but hey, now I know for next
time.

Anyway, the heroes wiped the floor with the goblins on the ground, and didn't
realize how much of a threat Frosz was until he only needed one more success.
When they finally killed him the Shadow Knight came out of hiding and grabbed
relic before the PCs could (compel). He then conceded, and the PCs wanted the
relic, so they knocked it out of his hand before he disappeared into the smoke
again. As he ran from the room he called back with a warning of his return.

## Final Thoughts

I definitely made some mistakes in this session, and the fight was a bit easier
than expected, but it still made for a good season finale for our campaign. The
combat was still pretty slow due to some analysis paralysis from the players,
but I'm going to try using a sand timer in the future to speed it up. For the
immediate future, we will not be continuing this campaign. We will do some
oneshots to try different settings and allow for less of a commitment. We might
continue this campaign in the future, but it will have to be once figure out a
feasible schedule for everyone. **What did you think of the campaign and this
fight? What would you have done differently?**
