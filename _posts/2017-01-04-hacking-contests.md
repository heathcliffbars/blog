Last night, I ran my first game to playtest a new setting that I am writing for 
[Fate Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/). The setting is a high 
fantasy world at the brink of international conflict with a focus on 
exploration. For the first session though, I kept things light and simple so 
that I could teach a new player the rules as we went and so that we could all 
get to know their characters. One tool that came in very handy for this was the 
[contest](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/contests).<!--more-->

## What is a Contest?
A contest in Fate is a mini-game, in a way, that lets the players discover the 
outcome of a an action (or several of actions) through a series of exchanges. It 
can be used to easily simulate a sporting event, a car chase, or a political 
debate. During each exchange of the contest, each side rolls a relevant skill 
against each other. Whoever has the highest roll gets a victory. The default is 
that the winner is the first to reach 3 victories, but this can be changed to 
accommodate different types of situations.

## The Drinking Contest

In last night's game, I threw in a drinking contest to give us some time to get 
to know the characters a little. It had no plot-moving purpose, but it was still 
a lot of fun! With the default setup for a Contest, it would be difficult to 
justify the narrative with the mechanics. How do you get three victories in 
drinking contest? Drinking contests only focus on one victory, and that is when 
one last person is still drinking after everyone else has made a mess of 
themselves. Instead of counting victories, drinking contests focus much more on 
the failures of everyone else. 

So to create a drinking contest for Fate, there are two things that we need to 
change: the opposition and the rules for winning. The opposition is easy. For 
this I used an increasing static difficulty. I started at Mediocre (+0) and 
increased the difficulty by one each exchange. The rules for winning were 
changed so that whenever someone fails, they fail to down the drink and are out 
of the contest. Success just means you get to keep playing and success with 
style grants you an invoke of a boost which can be called something like: *"You 
call that a drink?"* My group had a ton of fun with this. Marv, the NPC that 
challenged them, held out until the end, but ultimately lost to Avler, the human 
blacksmith.

## The One-upping Contest
Another type of modified contest that my group ran into was to tell the best 
story. Again, this was not to push plot, but to let the players get used to 
things. Marv has been on this boat for a bit and just wanted something to gamble 
over. Marv started off by telling a story about how he knows mermaids are real 
and then asked if anyone could top it.

The changes to create this contest were simple--lower the number of victories 
needed to win. In this case, I lowered that number all the way down to one. 
Whoever told the best story won the contest and whatever strange prize Marv was 
offering. This also was a lot of fun and got the players talk about things that 
we did not know about their characters.

## In Conclusion
Counting failures, passive (and increasing) opposition, and one-victoy wins are 
just a few ideas to make contests more versatile in your Fate games. I used them 
all just to tell us a little more about the characters, but there is nothing 
stopping you from using these tweaks in more important and dramatic situations.
