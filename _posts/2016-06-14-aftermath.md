The party, weary from battle, took some time to rest and then spoke with Gerald Greymore, leader of the Greyspire Rangers. Gerald asked some questions of the group to see if he could trust them. When he decided that he could, Gerald showed them the drawing that was found on the battlefield. A drawing of an artifact, very similar to the one that Desmond carries. Gerald also led them to a strange arcane symbol found at the back of Fort Greyspire and told the party that most of the rangers were away during the battle due to a banquet that was thrown for them by Tobias Bender in Beowood. The group then left for Stonehollow at Kyrie's suggestion that Old Man Berkle might know something of the artifact or the arcane symbols on the wall.
