#Welcome to my new blog!

##Introductions
My name is Nathan Hare, and I am a web developer and tabletop role playing game
enthusiast. My current RPG of choice is Fate Core, and I plan to use this site 
as an outlet for actual play reports, RPG tips, and my general thoughts and 
ideas. I hope you enjoy it!
