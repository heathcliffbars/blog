So yes, I have decided to start a blog, and I plan to fill it with things pertaining mostly
to tabletop role playing games. I have been teaching myself to play and Game Master the game 
[Fate Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core) and I will be continuing to learn it and 
documenting the process.  <!--more-->

## RPGs
I currently GM a campaign for my wife and friends, all of which I brought into the TRPG 
world. We started out playing 
[Dungeons & Dragons 5E](http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd) last year,
quickly moved to [Savage Worlds](http://www.peginc.com/product-category/savage-worlds/), 
and then to [Fate Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core). And since Fate is such a 
different animal than the rest, we're still getting the hang of narrative-based gameplay 
instead of the simulationism of Savage Worlds and D&D. I will be documenting our sessions 
on here via Actual Play Reports and pointing out any useful lessons I've learned while 
trying to understand the system.

The campaign we are in is basically a homebrew D&D type setting. It's not in the Forgotten 
Realms necessarily, but it's the same monsters and fantasy genre. We meet every other Tuesday
or Thursday and are currently approaching our 9th session and we will soon be hitting our 
first [Major Milestone](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/advancement-change#major-milestones). 
I'll do some recap on the story so far, and I'll try to post Actual Play Reports after each 
session.

## Web Development

The last thing I plan to use this blog for is to cover my web development projects. I have
two on here currently and I plan to be adding more in the future. This blog will give me a 
chance to explain how those resources work, why you would want to use them, improvements I 
plan on making/have made, and future projects that I plan to add.

I'll be adding a comments option to the site soon as well. So if you have thoughts or 
suggestions, please send them once that is available. Enjoy!
