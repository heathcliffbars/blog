Welcome back again for another post in my 
[Dungeons in Fate](http://rpg.nathanhare.net/tag/dungeons/) series. If you 
haven't read the previous articles, I am going through various tips for adding 
dungeons into your Fate games while still maintaining the narrative philosophies 
of Fate. In this post I'll be expanding on a topic I touched on in my 
[previous article about traps](http://rpg.nathanhare.net/2016/10/28/fantasy-dungeons-traps.html). 
Today, I'll talk about using secrets in your dungeon.<!--more-->

Dungeons often are meant to be mysterious and convey a sense of wonder, making 
secrets a powerful tool when creating dungeons in an RPG. However, secrets 
in-game are very different from secrets in real life. When we think of secrets, 
we usually think of information that must be kept secret and cannot be shared, 
but in an RPG if the players never discover a secret it is as if it never 
existed. All the players have is what is in the narrative, so if a secret is not 
found, in their eyes, it doesn't exist.

So I'm going to go against the advice of the phrase "Loose lips sink ships," and 
tell you to reveal your secrets. I don't mean that you should tell your players 
everything, but you should hint at it. In the short narrative above, there is a 
secret. Berkle, the wizard, ran into a dead end, but he was no where to be 
found. By setting up a scene in this way, the players know there is a secret to 
be found. They know that there is some hidden way of either hiding in or 
escaping the room. This sets them up to use their skills to find whatever 
secret there may be.

There are two ways to handle the player interaction at this point. One option is 
to plan out what happened. In the example, I was thinking that there is a hidden 
door in this room. If the players try searching for clues, they might find 
footprints leading straight into the wall, subtle straight seems in one section 
of the wall, or even a small hidden switch that opens the door. The other option 
is to not plan the outcome. Let the players guess at what the secret is and make 
rolls to determine if they are right. This makes for a more fluid dungeon that 
is actually being built by the players, but it does require more thinking on 
your feet.

To take this one step further, you don't even have to pre-plan where your 
secrets are
necessarily. You can put an aspect on the dungeon itself to clue your players 
in. Make the aspect something like *Mysterious Dungeon* or *Hidden Secrets*, and 
wait for opportunities to arise to compel the aspect and throw complications at 
the party. When you do this, remember to setup the secrets in a way that gives 
the players a hint. The players can also take advantage of the aspect and search 
for secrets. If they succeed, reward them by giving them something to find. It 
might be a good idea to at least throw together a list of possible secrets to 
find with this method, even if they don't have a designated location.

So there are some ideas of how to add some mystery to your dungeons without 
your players walking right passed it. **What tricks have you used to add secrets
to your Fate games?**
