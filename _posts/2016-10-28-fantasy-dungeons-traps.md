To continue the [Dungeons in Fate series]({{site.url}}/tag/dungeons/), today 
I'll be talking about traps and how to use them in your Fate games. Traps are 
often used in more traditional RPGs for several reasons. They can convey the 
danger of a location, provide information about the location's inhabitants,
weaken the heroes before they reach the enemies, or just provide a chance for 
the heroes to show off their skills. However, my ideas on how to implement traps 
in Fate are slightly different than its traditional counterparts.<!--more-->

There are various types of traps that fill different roles within a story. 
Traditionally in Fantasy RPGs, they have been most commonly designed as one-shot 
problems to test the characters' awareness and reaction times, but this isn't a 
lot of fun for the PCs. It slows down the game because it teaches the heroes to 
constantly search for these traps. If they manage to find a trap and disable it, 
then it ends up being a bunch of wasted time where nothing interesting happens. 
So to 
begin, I would recommend that you use traps sparingly, but if you do use them, 
here are some ways to use traps to add to the story.

## Add Story to the Dungeon
The Angry GM has a great blog post titled 
"[Traps Suck](http://theangrygm.com/traps-suck/)," where he talks about why he 
hates the way traps are usually used in 
RPGs. His remedy for this is to lay out traps in a pattern. As you layout your 
dungeon, continue placing these traps in accordance with the pattern that has 
been established, making them more challenging the further in they are.


One example he gives is in a tomb that the party is exploring. The adventurers 
find a section of the tomb that has crumbling stone from seismic activity. 
Amidst the stone is hidden a simple crossbow trap triggered by a tripwire. This 
tells the players that it was probably set by tomb raiders that wanted to 
prevent others from entering. As the group continues, they find more of the same 
trap where ever there is crumbling stone to hide it in. Later on in the 
adventure, the players get distracted and run down an unchecked hallway after a 
foe and accidentally trip one of the crossbow traps. 

The Angry GM's fix for this problem is well suited for a traditional 
step-by-step dungeon crawl, but its principles can be applied to Fate as well. 
If you want to design a recurring trap for your dungeon, design it in a way that 
tells the players something about the beings that set it up, and establish a 
pattern. The pattern can be an aspect. In the Angry GM's example the pattern 
aspect would be *Crumbling walls*. Whenever the players see this aspect later in 
the dungeon, they can expect that a compel will come out of it if they don't do 
anything to overcome it. Go ahead and allow them to clear a few traps after the 
initial one without issue, but of course, make sure to put them in situations 
where they don't have time to check an area that they assume is trapped as well. 
Send a foe to warn the others by running down the hallway filled with these 
traps. Will the heroes prepare for the coming hoard, or will they bum rush down 
the hallway to keep from alarming the others? There's some good drama!

## Traps as Characters

Piggybacking on the previous section and my 
[previous Dungeons in Fate post]({{site.url}}/2016/10/22/dungeons-scenes-and-scenarios.html), 
let's talk about trap scenes. Traps can get really interesting when they are 
planned as their own dedicated scenes. For these, think of pretty much every 
[Indiana Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr-8AP0To4k) trap, or the 
[Trash Compactor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U3Oti2L8S4&spfreload=10) 
scene in *Star Wars IV: A New Hope*, or the flooding 
pit trap from 
[Masters of Umdaar](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/155458/Masters-of-Umdaar--A-World-of-Adventure-for-Fate-Core?affiliate_id=24139) 
(pg. 36). These are traps that don't 
immediately affect the adventurers. Instead, they change the situation and force 
the players to deal with it.

Start by creating a trap that stands in the way of the PCs continuing and is 
interesting enough for the PCs to spend a scene dealing with it. Then, take a 
tip from the 
[Fate Fractal](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/extras#the-bronze-rule-aka-the-fate-fractal) 
and stat your trap as a character. You can do this 
as you like, but my suggestion is to use the following skills: Force, Secrets, 
Speed, and Structure. 

* **Force** represents the trap's overall force, whether it be the arrows it 
shoots, the water pouring down, or the walls closing in. Force is used to defend 
against attempts to forcefully stop the trap from continuing. This skill can 
also be used if the trap is attacking a player.
* **Secrets** represents the hidden pieces of the trap. How is it activated or 
deactivated? What is powering it? Secrets is used to defend against the heroes 
asking the previously mentioned questions.
* **Speed** represents the overall speed at which the trap moves or progresses.
It is used to defend against attempts to dodge, evade, or outrun the trap.
* **Structure** represents the construction of the trap. Is it of crude 
construction or are the walls large stone slabs? Structure defends against 
attempts to break free of the trap or destroy it.

Once you have your trap statted up, throw the PCs into a contest with it. They 
can enter the trap by a compel, a success at a cost, a choice, or just by having 
all of them roll, and the lowest roller goes in. Don't worry about figuring out 
the details about your trap unless those details are part of the story. 
Encourage your players to try different things to overcome the trap, even if 
they are on the outside trying to free their companion(s). As your players 
experiment with different approaches to disable the trap, you can then narrate 
what they did to work towards or against disabling the trap. Three failures 
means the trap wins, but three victories means the heroes successfully prevent 
the trap from reaching its end goal. 

#### Words of Warning
If you have a trap like a room filling with water, plan ahead for what failure 
should look like. Killing the PCs with the trap is usually not very fun for the 
players, so find some way of continuing the story through their failure. Maybe 
your enemies notice you unconscious in the water, pull you out and tie you up, 
or the PCs manage to escape the trap just as they are about to run out of breath 
and take a mild consequence of *Water-logged*. Instead of getting crushed by 
that boulder, the floor gives way and drops you into the dark dangerous sewers 
underneath the dungeon. Don't let failure end the story.

## Major and Minor Costs
Finally, you can also throw traps into your dungeon by using them as 
penalties for Success at a Cost. *"Your character failed to pick the lock? You 
get the door open, but it looks like you rushed it and set off a poison gas 
trap, giving you the aspect 'Feeling Sick'"*. Make sure that this is not 
used too often or your players might begin to try spending extra actions on 
checking every door and chest before they try opening them.

Once again, thanks for reading some of my thoughts on how to run a dungeon in 
Fate. I hope it is helpful! I'm not sure yet what next week's continuation of the 
series will be, but so far I have loot, secrets, and compellable aspects on the 
list, so check back for more next week!
