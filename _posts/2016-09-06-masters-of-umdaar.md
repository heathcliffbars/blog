Over Labor Day weekend, I had the privilege of running Masters of Umdaar for the first
time. I ran the game at the [Gamers of Summer](http://www.gamersofsummer.net/) conference in 
Harrisburg, PA. We only had two players since I didn't schedule it ahead of time, but we still 
had a lot of fun. One player was Andy, who plays Filius, the Gnome Bard, in our 
*[Relics of Acyrus](http://nathanhare.net/rpg/blog/tag/the%20relics%20of%20acyrus)* 
campaign. The other player was a guy named Fred.<!--more-->

## The PCs
Andy decided to go with a Sneaky undead mage named Abraxas. Fred went with a Flashy light being 
named CG-13 who somehow evolved a long time ago from being a program used to create special 
effects for movies. He had a lot of fun narrating every action he did as some kind of movie trope.

## The Story
The game played out to be a lot of fun, but I did make a few changes because some of the defaults
seemed a little strange. The PCs started by meeting Manc the Merc in the Thornhog and a challenge 
seemed strange since they generally for unopposed situations, and Manc is all statted up to 
oppose them. I set it up as a contest instead with the PCs trying to discover where the starblade
was and Manc trying to figure out their intentions so he could alert Kaji-Sa. It ended up working
well, and the PCs easy defeated Manc in the contest and discovered where Kaji-Sa was headed next.

Parts of the adventure seem pretty railroady as well, like just hand-waving the choice of following
Kaji-Sa on the path and having the PCs bushwack through the jungle. I gave my players the choice,
and eventually compelled the Hallucinogenic Fog aspect to have them wander deep into the jungle.
They then wiped out the laser-wolves quickly and found the temple.

CG-13 had actually filmed at this temple, long before the Demiurge had abandoned the planet, but
a trap had been installed since the last time. CG-13 fell into the trap while Abraxas was stuck 
on the outside trying to help his companion. I really threw all of my fate points at them for this
one, and they barely made it out on the last exchange. It made for a tense scene.

And finally, the PCs reached the starblade. They were very cautious of the blade being trapped, 
but eventually grabbed it as they could hear someone coming in from the entrance. Abraxas hid 
behind the pedastal while CG-13 grabbed the blade and swung it around as Bruce Lee would in 
preparation for the coming threat. The two quickly dispatched Kaji-Sa's Raptorborg Soldiers and
then went in on her. In fear for her life, she ran, but not before the PCs were able to knock 
her starblade away from her.

## Conclusion
We all had a lot of fun with the setting and adventure. Aside from the couple of small things 
that mentioned, I thought it was a great intro adventure to Fate as it clearly lays out the 
scenes and various different mechanics. As the GM, I have only handled social encounters as 
contests/conflicts a couple times, so that was good practice for me too! I'll definitely be running 
this game again in the future! **Have you ever run Masters of Umdaar? What were your thoughts 
on it?**
