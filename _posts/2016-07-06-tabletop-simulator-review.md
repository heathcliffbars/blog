Over the weekend, I was itching to play since my normal RPG group has been all over
the place for the summer. I ended up running a game for people who had never played 
Fate before on [Tabletop Simulator](http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/) by 
[Berserk Games](http://berserk-games.com/) using the [Fate Workshop Item
](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599419364&searchtext=fate) 
that I created. So I decided to write up a review so that others can get an idea of
how Tabletop Simulator works for Fate and other RPGs.<!--more-->

## The Game

First off, I hosted a server (which is incredibly easy) and left it open for people
to join. We ended up with two players, but could have easily had more if I was willing
to wait a little longer. 

The adventure we ran was *Tower of the Serpents* from the 
[Fate: Worlds on Fire](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-worlds-volume-one-worlds-on-fire/)
book. One change that I made was that we ran it in Fate Accelerated rather than Core.
This change was made to make character creation quicker. I had to write my own stats 
for NPCs on the fly, but it wasn't hard to quickly convert them.

**(Warning! This paragraph contains spoilers)** The adventure is all about this artifact 
which is held in a mysterious tower in the middle of the slums of a city. In the tower
lives a powerful sorcerer who only leaves during the night of the full moon. Before 
entering the tower, the PCs approached by three different groups that all want this 
artifact, and are willing to pay, hurt, or kill for it. The PCs then enter the tower,
retrieve the artifact, and are faced with some difficult choices upon returning to the
city.

Due to time constraints, we only got to the part of the adventure where the PCs had
just jumped over the wall into the garden surrounding the tower, but we still had a 
great chance to try it out, and even went through a full conflict.

## Pros

### Community

So what did I like about Tabletop Simulator? Well, I would say one huge benefit is 
the community. If you are okay with playing games with strangers, this is a great 
way to do it. Just start a server and wait for people to show up. People will then 
trickle in and you can start a game. If you are not okay with playing with strangers,
your friends can easily join you for a game if they are willing to spend $19.99 one 
time on the game.

### Flexibility

Another great thing about it is the flexibility. Tabletop Simulator honestly works
very much like a real table in front of you. Yes, some things are a little bit 
clunkier than in real life, but it does a great job simulating everything. And on 
top of simulating a real life table, you also have the ability to copy and paste 
things, delete, and pull props out of thin air. There is a massive amount of built
in tools and props, but there is also an infinite number of player made content that
can be thrown into any Fate game.

### Tools

There are a ton of tools to use in game. We used the drawing tool to draw out a map
on the table. We also used built in props to create the feel of the location. 
Notecards were used for scene aspects and such and the in-game voice chat made it very
easy to communicate. 

### Price Point

The cost of Tabletop Simulator is $19.99 which is great considering how many games
you are actually getting for that price. You pay that fee once to purchase the game,
but then you have access to [almost 10,000 workshop items
](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=286160&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems&actualsort=trend&p=1&days=7) 
created by the players for free. This is great incentive to get your online group to buy it
since it is not *only* for RPGs.

## Cons
---

### Clunky

The game can be a bit clunky and slow. If you are throwing tons of 3D animated minis
into the game it will obviously slow dowm. But even things like writing on note cards
or rolling dice can be a bit clunky. Sometimes you'll roll your dice and one will go
flying off into the abyss and then reappear in the center of the table. This is only
a minor problem, but it is still worth noting.

### No Character Sheets

Currently, Tabletop Simulator doesn't have a built in method for handling character
sheets. Because Fate character sheets are so simple, I made some out of the in-game
notecards, but it is really a work around and not ideal. For other RPGs on Tabletop
Sim. the in game tablets are used to display online character sheets, but tablets 
still don't seem to work on Linux or Mac unfortunately. Otherwise, I would load up
the [Fate Character Sheet](http://nathanhare.net/rpg/fatecore/) page and make things 
a lot simpler.

## Summary
---

Overall, we had a great time playing Fate in Tabletop Simulator. We were able to do 
everything we wanted to do and there was more I thought of afterward that I could 
have done to increase immersion like changing the background or using the MP3 
player for background music. There are some things that could be improved to make
for easier RPG play, but even with its current issues, the game works well. And 
lastly, if you like board games too, its a great buy for that reason alone.

**Have you ever tried playing Fate or another RPG in Tabletop Simulator? What were
your thoughts on the experience?**
