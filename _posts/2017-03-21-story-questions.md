Unfortunately, my previous game fell through. The players are unable to 
play for the time being, so I wasn't able to finish the series I was 
working on about 
[scenario preparation]({{site.url}}/2017/02/02/scenario-prep-part-1.html). 
However, I have continued analyzing 
techniques for good game prep in other groups and wanted to throw out a thought of the day,
similar to what [Robert Hanz](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RobertHanz) does from 
time to time. For this post, I want to
dig a little deeper into story questions.<!--more-->

In *Fate Core*, the 
*[Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/scenes-sessions-scenarios)* 
chapter talks a lot 
about setting up a good story for your players to interact with, and this whole 
process starts out with story questions. 

As with many of my mistakes with Fate, on my first read of this section 
I did not fully understand it. I thought these were meant to be specific 
questions that answer something about a specific scene that has already been 
planned out. My early game prep consisted of using aspects to create story 
questions that were used to pre-plan a series of scenes. I might create a story 
question that asks "Will the adventurers discover the true identity of the mayor?", 
and then plan a scene where they meet with the mayor to find out in a 
conversation with him. The problem 
with this though, is that it leaves no room for player input. Either you force 
the players to follow your prescribed plan, or you waste a lot of time planning 
when the players handle it in a different way. 

I recently read a 
[blog post](http://theangrygm.com/four-things-youve-never-heard-of-that-make-encounters-not-suck/) 
by the Angry GM about making encounters not suck. It was a very interesting read
overall, but his first point is especially relevant. He talks about something 
called the *Dramatic Question* which is
essentially the same thing as a story question. He talks about how the dramatic
question is what makes a scene engaging. It is what keeps you on the edge of 
your seat wondering if the heroes will succeed or fail. The question informs the 
GM of how to create tension by making it challenging to accomplish its goal.

So what does this mean for us Fate players? Story questions are extremely 
important, but they shouldn't be used to limit your games. In our previous
example, "Will the adventurers discover the true identity of the Mayor?", this 
can be a question for any number of different scenes. After the PCs get wind 
that something is fishy, they might try breaking into the man's house at night and
look for clues. Or maybe they'll ask people that are close to him about strange 
behavior. They might even leave that question aside, and only realize what they 
overlooked when it comes back to bite them later. All of this, though, is left 
up to the players to decide how they want to handle it.

Story questions can also be used to spur your players into action. They aren't
biting on the "Who's the mayor?" question? Throw in a mob of angry towns folk
that are gathering outside due to the mayors sporadic change in policies. Or 
move the mayor's plans forward as he goes uncontested.

Lastly, story questions can be used to make a scene more dramatic. Once you know
the goal of a scene, you can make it more dramatic by focusing on actions aimed
at answering the question being asked. If the heroes are trying to collect 
powerful weapons so that they don't fall into the wrong hands, a scene where the
baddies come to steal the weapons from the PCs makes a lot of sense. Even better, focus 
all of your GM fate points on stealing those weapons, and you've got some great 
drama.

I say this as much for myself as any of you readers, but go into your games with 
story questions at hand and let the players decide how they accomplish their 
goals. This allows the players to be in control and gives the GM some great
tools to keep the story exciting. So that's what I've got for today. **What do 
you think about story questions? What else are they good for?**
