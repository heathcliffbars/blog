About a week ago, the regular RPG group and I got together, but James (who plays Eb), couldn't make it due to his new job. Instead of trying to play the game without Eb, we decided to try a one shot and we tried doing it without a GM. I'll leave the specifics about how we played without a GM for another post. This one is just the play report. So here's how it went.<!--more-->

# No GM Rules

In order to play without a GM, we obviously needed to change a few things about Fate. It 
relies on a GM, but not as much as other systems do, so I thought wouldn't be too hard to
do. I had been intrigued by the idea of playing GMless for a while, but after reading 
systems like [Mythic GM Emulator](http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html), [Fateless](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/151493/FateLess), and [nihless](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/3ehsf8/nihiless_a_gmless_rulesmoderate_system_designed/), I was still looking
for something that had that core Fate play style and didn't add a ton of new rules. So after 
thinking about it a lot, I came to some conclusions on how to do it.

* The GM doesn't roll. Only difficulties are set
* No GM Fate Points
* Refresh is reduced to 2 to compensate for the lack of GM Fate Points
* Compels always give Fate Points from the general pool and not from a specific player
* All opposition is determined by the group, going up or down from the highest skill based on difficulty
* A framing card is past around at the end of every scene, whoever has a framing card sets the scene, picks a purpose, location, present characters, and an environment and obstacle aspect.
* If you ever don't feel comfortable just adding to the scene once it is framed, you can ask the dice a yes or no question
  * Set the difficulty up or down from 0 based on the likeliness
  * Roll 4 fate dice
    * **Success with style**: Yes, and...
    * **Success**: Yes
    * **Tie**: Yes, but... OR No, but...
    * **Fail**: No
    * **Fail Miserably** (by 3 or more): No, and...
* NPCs are played by whoever is not talking to them at the time
* Create NPCs like this: *Nasty Goblin lvl3*
  * "Nasty Goblin" is the High Concept
  * "lvl3" determines the skills
    * NPCs have two skills, "Good At" and "Decent At"
    * The "Good At" skill level is equal to the NPCs level (+3 in this case)
    * The "Decent At" skill level is half (rounded up) of the NPCs level (+2 in this case)
  * "lvl3" also determines stress and consequences
    * Levels 1, 2, and 3 are for Average (+1), Fair (+2), and Good (+3) Nameless NPCs, respectively
    * A four and up is a main NPC. Levels above 4 can represent extra stress boxes and/or consequences
* Some other systems have "Action Words" like Dispute, Veto, Pause, etc. These are useful,
but not always necessary if your group knows eachother and knows how to jump in and out of
context easily. I assume that the more you play without a GM, the less you actually need to 
use action words.

I am still working on it, and I plan to make a full document write up of it once I work out the kinks, but this is what I have so far.

## World Creation

I told the group about the 
[We Be Goblins](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8j5w?Pathfinder-Module-We-Be-Goblins)
adventures released on [Free RPG day](http://www.freerpgday.com/), and they seemed interested in it. I mentioned that 
we could try a goblin PC game, and they jumped on it.

The world creation went pretty quick. We are goblins in a tribe that took over an abandoned 
mine. Our current issue is that *The Humans are Expanding" and starting to venture into our 
mine. The impending issue is that *The blue ball is glowing!". The blue ball is a great 
blue gem that was found in the deeper parts of our mine. It is worshiped by some of the 
religious goblins in the tribe and has recently started glowing for unknown reasons.  

## Character Creation

### Kyle

**Played by:** Andy

Kyle is a brutish goblin known for being good with an axe.

### Oggleward

**Played by:** Me! (Nate)

Oggleward is a scrawny goblin and nephew of the cheif. He is an embarrasment to his family
since he enjoys to dance tribal dances to seek the great blue ball's blessing. He is not 
good in combat, but instead has learned some crude illusionary magic from the Blue Ball.

### Stabby Breakjaw

**Played by:** Carl

Stabby is a berserker type goblin always hungry for a fight.

## Action!

### Scene 1 - The Goblin Camp
The game started in our camp within the mines. Oggleward was making a windchime from bones
while Kyle sharpened his axe and Stabby ate by the fire. The chief sent off a final group 
to guard the enterance of the mines from the humans and then asked for volunteers for a 
special mission. Kyle and Stabby quickly volunteered while Oggleward tried to hide among 
the crowd. The chief caught sight of him though and forced him to join the mission in hopes
it would make a man out of him. The Chief told them that their mission was to cripple the
humans from the inside and find a way to make them never return to the mine.

### Scene 2 - Fuzzy's Lair
After asking the dice, we determined that there was an alternate enterance to the cave that
could be used to exit without the notice of the humans. Unfortunately, it was the home of 
Fuzzy, the giant boar. Hoping Fuzzy wasn't home, we snuck into the lair with torches
doused. Some more questions to the dice determined that Fuzzy was home, but was hiding out 
of site. We looked around for her and saw nothing until Oggleward created a magical light to
illuminate the room. As soon has he did, Fuzzy jumped off of the ledge she was hiding on and 
attacked. Oggleward ran and threw up a giant illusionary goblin head to scare her, while Kyle
and Stabby went to town creating advantages. When enough invokes we stacked up, Kyle went in
for a devistating final blow with his axe. Fuzzy was statted very low because I didn't have 
NPC creation down at that point, so it was a pretty quick fight.

## Conclusion
It was a short game due to time constraints, but even though we didn't do a whole lot, it 
was a lot of fun! From what I could tell, everyone felt like they played a huge part in the
story, and we never actually knew what was going to happen next. It was a bit awkward at
first since none of us have done any improv classes, but we still had a great time, with
no prep.
