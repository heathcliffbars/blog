[Fate Core Character Sheet](/rpg/fatecore/) is another project that I have made. It is basically just a
form-based version of the actual 
[character sheet](http://www.evilhat.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fate-Core-Character-Sheet.pdf).

## Inspiration
I enjoy playing games on 
[Tabletop Simulator](http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/) every once in
a while. So much so that I made 
[this mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=599419364) so that you
can play Fate games on it. The mod is set up so that your character sheet is a series of 
note cards. This works fine, but it is a little clunky. Tabletop Simulator does have 
tablets though. 

So if the character sheet is available and editable online, each player
could have their own tablet and keep their character sheet on it.And that is why I made 
this project. So that you can easily use a Fate Core character sheet on Tabletop 
Simulator. That is not it's only usage though.

## Usage
The usage of this program is super simple currently. Basically, you can fill out any of
the fields to keep track of things and you can increase or decrease the number of mental
and physical stress boxes you have using the plus and minus signs in the section heading.

## Future
After creating it, I thought of some really cool uses for this program. The first is to 
add serialization of the sheets content. This would allow someone to fill it out and 
then copy a link. Punch that link back into your browser and it brings you right back
to where you left off. I am confident that I can do this, but I never have before, so 
it will be a learning process to impliment. 

Another thing that I would like to add is a dice roller. I hope to make the skill levels
clickable. When you click them, four fate dice are rolled and the skill level is added
to the result and displayed on screen.
