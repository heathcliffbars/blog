I've been thinking recently about traditional simulation-based RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, 
Pathfinder, and Savage Worlds in comparison storytelling based games like Fate. More specifically, 
I have been trying to figure out why the transition from traditional RPGs to Fate is so difficult. 
Ultimately, both types of games are about generating a cool story that has been lived in together 
by the whole group. So what's the problem? How can they be so different if they do the same 
thing? <!--more-->With these thoughts in mind, I wanted to have a response for 
why the transition is so tough and what the difference actually is. So here's what I've come up with.

I believe the main difference is the focus. Now, maybe you have already figured this out. I mean,
they are rightfully called simulation and storytelling RPGs because that is what they focus on. 
However, what that actually means was never clear to me or others in my gaming group during our 
transition to storygaming.

In simulation-based RPGs, the focus is
very much on rules and simulation. There is a story, but the rulebooks are filled with 
game mechanics that try to emulate specific actions and events. Everything you do in game has a 
rule laid out for it, or if it doesn't, it has a rule that can be used to get close enough to 
how something would actually happen. The story is almost a biproduct. Aside from the 
Game Master/Dungeon Master's role, the story is never brought to the forefront and considered 
when determining what what is going on in it. In fact, bringing up the story can often be 
considered metagaming, and is usually looked down upon in simulation RPGs. Instead of actively 
talking about the story being created, the story is left to be generated by the mechanics and 
player decisions. When a roll is made, the roll itself determines parts of the story. When someone
tries to do something, the mechanics determine how things move forward. The players do add to the 
story with their decisions, but the outcomes of those decisions are handled by the mechanics. 
The mechanics, combined with player decisions make up the players' side of the story. This is 
not to say that this is a bad thing. It is not. Many people, including me, love playing games 
in this way. It is just a different approach.

Fate, on the other hand, focuses on the story. Instead of having unique rules to simulate every 
situation, you have generalized rules. These generalized rules work because they are rules to 
create story rather than simulate a reality. The Fate Point Economy focuses on creating a story 
that is 
interesting and fun. Mechanics like compels, invokes, and concessions are all there to make
for a better story. In Fate, the GM and the players are actively talking about the story you are 
creating as you are creating it, so that it is a better one. Having the story front and center 
means that you often know more about the story than you would in a simulation game, but knowing 
more is okay. This type of "metagaming" in Fate is encouraged, because it increases investment in
the story. Instead worrying about if the heroes will prevail, the players and the GM alike are
the opportunity to alter the outcomes in a balanced way, based on what they think would make for 
a good story. Rather than reacting to the mechanics and randomness of the dice, in Fate, everyone 
at the table is actively telling a story together. 

Basically, my conlcusion is that simulation RPGs build their rules specifically to simulate a 
fictional reality, while Fate has rules designed to directly affect and create a great story. 
Now again, I don't write this to say one type of RPG is better than the other. My preferences may
be clear, but it is just that - a preference. Both styles have their place 
and both shine in different ways. Play whatever your group enjoys! For those who may be 
struggling with this same thought process, I hope this helps. **What do you think makes the
transition so difficult? What has helped you understand the differences? Let me know in the
