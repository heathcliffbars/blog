## The Story

### Diving Deeper

The group left off being attacked by powerful Giant Cave Spiders. The spiders proved too
strong for the party, and so they chose to run. Leaving behind their rations to distract
the spiders, they ran and disguised themselves as part of the cavern wall thanks to 
Filius's magic. They waited until spider's left and then approached the sigil once again.

They chose to head down, deeper into the mountain, in pursuit of whatever it was that
carried a light to the door just before them. The sigil was to be a *legendary*
magical seal, but with the calm concetrative melody of Filius's song *Unlock the truth*, 
and the knowledge that Aurora and Eb have of sigils and stone, Desmond was able to decipher 
the lock. The stone slid away with sound of grinding rock and revealed a new tunnel that headed
deeper into the darkness.

As they headed down the tunnel, a blue light appeared directly in front of Desmond, and
out of popped a scroll. The scroll unravelled and delivered Desmond with some information
on using the artifact of conjuration that he carried in his pocket. With the artifact, he
now knew how to teleport himself, and those touching him, back to Fort Greyspire. At the 
bottom of the note was Old Man Berkle's signature.

### An Old Friend

The group continued forward to a break in the tunnels. A soft red glow dimly lit the
opening. Filius crept ahead to peer out of the tunnel and saw that a section of the
of the tunnel collapsed into a large cavern with bioluminescent red mushrooms scattered 
about the walls. Filius also spotted two goblins sneaking away into he rest of the 
continuation of the tunnel on the other side of the rubble. 

As he did, a kackle echoed out through the cavern. A party of gnoll slavers approached
the intersection with one dwarven monk in tow behind them. Eb quickly recognized the dwarf
to be his buddy, Mafol, that trained with him in the Power of Temperance. Without a second
to think, he cast a spell to cover the floor around the gnolls in ice. A battle ensued
and the adventurers easily took down the gnolls with mainly arrows and some conjuration
magic. In the confusion, Mafol, was able to sneak away and hide until the fight was over.

### The Temple of Divinity

Eb reunited with Mafol and he agreed to help the party in whatever way he could. So they 
continued on, down the rest of the tunnel until they reached a structure resembling some 
kind of temple. Along the front wall was a phrase written in ancient elven: "See what
remains unseen." The group entered to find a bottomless pit keeping them from continuing. 
With the elvish phrase running through their heads, Eb called forth a rain storm in the
room. The rain fell straight into the pit except for one narrow strip, as if there were 
an invisible bridge. The party carefully tested and then walked across this bridge to 
the far end of the room, where another complication was found.

A pair of human legs laid on the ground and a narrow corridor was splattered with blood,
but nothing dangerous was visible. After some debate, the group decided there must be a
pressure plate some where, so they threw the legs back into the corridor and two stone 
shifted out of the walls and slammed together. Discovering the location of the trap, the 
group carefully bypassed it and found another peice of the human body: an arm. In its hand
was a book diagraming the puzzles and traps in the temple, although, the stone slabs were 
illustrated a little higher than they turned out to be.

The group continued on through the ancient structure, solving the puzzles as illustrated
in the journal. As they went from room to room they noticed a black smoke growing in
volume, but were not sure what to think of it. That is, until they reached the final
room.

### The Shadow Knight

The smoke was thick in this room. A statue of a sphinx stood 25 feet tall in the middle 
of the room and the alter in front of them, where the artifact was expected to be, laid
empty. A slow clap echoed from behind the sphinx and a tall dark figure emerged from the
smoke. The figure was armored from head to toe. He carried in one hand a flail that 
emitted the black smoke from its head, and in the other, the relic of divinity. He laughed 
said in a raspy voice "Well done. I thought you'd never make it." As he approached, the 
Relic of Divinity began to glow, as did Desmond's pocket where he kept the Relic of 
Conjuration. "Well. I only came down here for one artifact, and you've brought me a 
second" the figure said as he gave a malicious chuckle.

## GM Notes

This session may have been our best yet. I have been doing a lot of learning as a GM for
the past couple of months. Unfortunately, due to everyone's sechedules, I haven't had
a lot of chances to put that learning to use, until last night that is. For this session,
I really focused on engaging the players and making it fun for them. I know, this is GMing
101 advice here, but it took me some time to figure out how it works in Fate. I really
tied in the characters to the story, and I believe I gave some interesting choices and 
complications. Unfortunately, we did run out of time at the end, and had to save the 
final confrontation until next time.
